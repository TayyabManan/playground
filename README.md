## 🎯 What is This?

This playground is designed to make machine learning concepts more intuitive and accessible through:

- **Visual Learning** - See how algorithms actually work, not just read about them
- **Interactive Exploration** - Tweak parameters and watch changes happen in real-time
- **Step-by-Step Understanding** - Break down complex processes into digestible steps
- **Hands-On Practice** - Learn by doing, not just watching
- **No Setup Required** - Everything runs in your browser

## 🧠 What You Can Learn

### 1. Backpropagation Visualizer
**Understand how neural networks actually learn**

Watch gradients flow backward through a neural network in real-time. This visualizer helps you understand:
- How the chain rule works in practice
- Why gradients can vanish or explode
- How different activation functions affect gradient flow
- The relationship between forward and backward passes
- How loss propagates back through layers

**What You'll See:**
- Interactive computation graph with live values
- Step-by-step gradient calculations
- Color-coded gradient magnitudes
- Editable network architecture
- Multiple computation examples (Q1-Q5 from neural network fundamentals)

**Perfect For:**
- Students learning backpropagation for the first time
- Debugging why your neural network isn't training
- Understanding gradient flow issues
- Preparing for ML interviews

### 2. ML Matrix Calculator *(Coming Soon)*
**Master the math behind neural networks**

An interactive calculator that shows you exactly how neural network operations work under the hood:
- Matrix multiplication for layer computations
- Forward pass calculations
- Weight updates and gradient descent
- Activation functions applied to matrices

**What Makes It Special:**
- Exact arithmetic (no floating-point errors)
- Step-by-step breakdowns of each operation
- Export working code to PyTorch, TensorFlow, or NumPy
- Visual matrix transformations

**Perfect For:**
- Understanding what happens in each layer
- Debugging dimension mismatches
- Learning how frameworks implement operations
- Converting math notation to code

## 🌟 Philosophy

This playground follows three core principles:

1. **Show, Don't Tell** - Visualizations over equations
2. **Interactive First** - Learning by doing, not just watching
3. **Depth Through Simplicity** - Start simple, allow deep exploration

The goal isn't to replace textbooks or courses, but to be the tool you wish you had when learning these concepts yourself.

## 💭 Why I Built This

Whenever I tried to learn new ML concepts, I always searched for resources that would let me **see** and **interact** with the ideas - not just read equations or watch static diagrams. I wanted to tweak parameters, break things, and understand through experimentation.

But I could never find resources like that. Most tutorials were either:
- Text-heavy with intimidating math notation
- Static diagrams that didn't respond to my questions
- Code-only with no visual intuition
- Too simplified to be useful, or too complex to be accessible

So I built the learning tools I wish existed when I was struggling with these concepts. This playground is what I would have wanted when I first learned about backpropagation, gradient descent, and neural networks.

If you've ever felt frustrated by purely theoretical explanations or wished you could just **see** how something works - this is for you.
